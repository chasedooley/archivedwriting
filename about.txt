# About

Chase Dooley, born 1996. My aim in life is to be a good man. I want to live a good and simple life, one guided by philosophy and in which I make a difference in the lives of others. 

My most valuable contribution to this world, so far, is perhaps [my list of mostly free resources for almost everyone](https://github.com/chasedooley/mostly-free-resources-for-almost-everyone).
