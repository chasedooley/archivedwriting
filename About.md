# About

This is the journal of Chase Dooley. It serves to collect my notes, thoughts, inspiration, and discoveries. This journal is for me, but I believe anyone can find value in it, so I choose to share it.

## About Chase Dooley

chase@chasedooley.com

I write because I have much to learn about myself. I want to know who I am. What do I value, what do I want, and what is mine to give? In  answering these questions and others, I hope to learn something  fundamental about life, living, and the universe. I share my writing,  believing that what I discover is valuable to my reader, who may seek to answer similar questions about themselves.

What do I want? To live a good and simple life, one in which I make a  difference in the lives of others. What is my aim in life? To make  living itself an art.    

I have three writing projects:

- Web-based books (coming in June).
- Essays on Substack (starting 5/1/21).
- [Journal, my daily blog](https://journal.chasedooley.com) that catalogs my process, notes, and more.
