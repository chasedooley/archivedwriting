Late again. Oops!

This week: I rediscovered minimalism. And I had this thought: minimalism is an example of "preferred poverty," an idea I got from Seneca. In Letter 87, he said that poverty could be something someone desired, preferred even to wealth. I may do some research and write an essay on it. Apart from that, I'm into one-bag, minimalist travel. I watched a video of Rob Greenfield, an activist who lives with just 47 possessions that fit in a backpack. His example makes me wonder if I could not do the same, or at least cut down how much I have -- down to the essential items for my life.

Getting back into minimalism, I found this quote from Thoreau in *Walden*, "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." It made me wonder how much of my life I am wasting on things.

I want to study literature at some point. This thought came up, too: I am more interested in literature (and writing) than philosophy. I think there's some truth to that since my interest in philosophy is limited to practical topics. After that, my interest falls off quickly. But I suppose it doesn't matter; I don't have to choose between them. That, and there's already a considerable overlap between them.

Reading update: I finished *Dreyer's English* by Benjamin Dreyer. It was great, and I recommend it. This week, I picked up *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* by Joseph Campbell, and so far, I'm enjoying it. It's denser than Dreyer but interesting. I also read an essay, ["Have We Forgotten How to Read Critically?" by Kate Harding](https://www.damemagazine.com/2022/01/07/have-we-forgotten-how-to-read-critically/), which was very good.
