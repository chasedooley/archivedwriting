I am going to sacrifice my life to an aim (but what is that aim?).

- Reading chapter 10 of *Beyond Order* by Jordan Peterson.
- Listening to the ["Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard (Existentialism)"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1RazyAG9ruCZYGXoKgd88r?si=192d197d35384427) episode of the Jordan B. Peterson Podcast.
- Thinking that I need to grow up: educate and discipline myself, find an aim and go after it, etc.

## tasks:

1. Writing my first essay
   - Continue writing my Substack about me
   - Continue my writing research
   - Organize my notes and research into a coeherent argument with five rationales.
2. Organize my life around a coeherent plan.
   - Who am I, who could I be, what do I want, and where do I want to go?
   - What is my aim? Philosophy versus science (you don't have to be trained as philosopher to say important and valuable things).
   - How many parts to my education?
   - For each part, what does it consist of? (The first part may be to educate myself, so reading the big books of my time: Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Jung, etc.) [Outline my path]
   - Compare programs to study; outline a plan;  What criteria matters here? What will I not give up despite these programs? What are five rationales for each program?
3. Reading and journaling
   - Update my reading list in support of my new education ambition
   - Work on my reading notes for *Originals*
   - Set up notes for *Beyond Order*. Questions, etc.
   - Journal: Aims, committment, and so on.
   - Read my book; try to finish it.
4. Quick tasks
   - Research flights to Colorado: when, how much.
   - Confirm dates with family; schedule COVID vaccines.
   - Organize and publish my late today's to my journal.

## notes, thoughts, and future tasks.

- What are the fundamental things of my college education I don't want to give up? What are the goals, aims? Learn to write, think, and speak.
- You know how difficult it is to write well, and that is your intention. So why do you force yourself to unrealistic deadlines and ambitions? What is more important: learning what I need to learn, in essence, loosing my arrogance, or keeping face and preserving my untempered ambitions? I need to learn to write and think and communicate, and I need to not worry about building an audience. That may come later, after I have done the work of the beginner, after I have demonstrated my value.
- I should complete the Self-Authoring program again.
