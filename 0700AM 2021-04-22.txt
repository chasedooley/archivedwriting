# 7:00 AM

I am going to sacrifice my life to this aim: to make living itself an art.

- Reading *Beyond Order* by Jordan Peterson.
- Listening to "Masollan" by Balmorhea.

# last night's notes:

What does Jordan Peterson say about the purpose of a college education? To learn to think well, write well, and speak well (is that right?). And that, in essence, is a liberal education (historically designed). So what programs would help me to think well, write well, and speak well? (Perhaps mathematics and philosophy.) I should take inspiration from the program made for generalists that was described in *Range* (by David Epstein).

# tasks

- Convert, revise, and publish more content to my journal; perhaps tackle my journal entries? Write a list of all the things I should put to my journal (things I could, should, and probably shouldn't)
- Answer: how should I use my book notes? What is the point of reading and how should that dictate how I use my notes?
- Tell my family I love them (and that I plan to fly back to CO for my things).
- Revise my website's homepage; implements analytics if desired; and launch it. Consider whether I should include links to my books and Substack pages (before they are ready).
- Generate more ideas for my writing.
- Decide which topic I am going to start with; plan out the release dates; and make an outline of how to start and go about the process (research day, write day, edit day, revise day, publish day).
- Update my reading list
- Brainstorm my Substack issue; write my Substack about me/about this.
- Think about my notes from last night.
