I am still sick but getting better. I haven't done much but read and think.

I finished *Several Short Sentences About Writing* by Verlyn Klinkenborg; the book is fantastic. I'm embracing sentence-first writing.

And I thought about whether we are obligated to achieve a higher role if we could. If someone could become a doctor, should they? I worry that I could do more.

I feel the urge to read and write more. I have a lot of work to do. And I'm excited to start.
