I am going to sacrifice my life to this aim: To making living itself an art.

## tasks:

- write an about-me for my Journal and for Substack; read and possible revise my current about-me.
- implement analytics for my pages. Take a look at Blot's analytics options and decide if one is good enough, or if I'm just not going to use analytics on that site.
- set up my pro email account (Fastmail, "chase@chasedooley.com")
- configure my journal as a subdomain for my main site.
- convert and upload my content to my journal.
- publish / launch my new websites.
- look into getting a UPS address for my newsletter.
- Decide when I am going back to Colorado for my belongings.

## schedule:

- 0700 - Plan the day
- 0710 - Write about-me's for journal and substack
- 0900 - Breakfast; set up pro email account
- 1000 - Revise about-mes.

## other tasks:
- copyright for my journal; or no copyright? get link
- trying switching the font to something interesting, like Epilogue, if possible. Or use a system font and perhaps save some load time.

## now
- I'm reading *Originals* by Adam Grant. Next will be *Beyond Order* by Jordan Peterson.
- I'm listening to ["Handing Lanterns" by Kalaido](https://open.spotify.com/track/7JJioso8L2geuDnkJyF0jD?si=5a24430a6faa4850).
