I am going to sacrifice my life to an aim. (What aim?)

- Reading chapter 7 of *Beyond Order* by Jordan Peterson
- Listening to the ["Admiral James Stavridis on James Stockdale and the Voyage of Character"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2QL6kL4VTmylxsX88xSqpj?si=10199653fd724801) episode of the Daily Stoic podcast.
- Thinking about aims, commitments, and a career in biomedical science.

## tasks

- Writing research and outlining argument(s)
- Journaling on aims, commitments, and my future.
- Spiritual exericses on the lessons of Epictetus.
- Reading notes

## other tasks

- Read my book
- Consider whether biomedical science or mathematical biology make the better choice for me. What criteria matters here? What will I not give up despite these programs? What are five rationales for each program?
- Consider that my aim in life, at least for now, is to become educated.
- Outline my path to education: 1, 2, 3. Books, courses, university, and beyond, discipline; body, mind, and spirit; and my reasons and motivations for it; and my goals / aims.

## other notes and thoughts

- What if my Substack became a community that taught how to write? Take in subscriber essays and my essays, critique them and improve them.
- That I should write less essays but better essays. My plan is to do a short essay every day. But what if I did one or two essays per week (the standard by the best journalists, if I recall right), and ensure that I put my best effort in mastering each one, dialing in my arguments, logic, and use of language.
