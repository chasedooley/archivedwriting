# Henry Miller on why a man writes

> “God wants us to be happy,” said Nijinsky. Likewise an author hopes that in giving himself to the world he will enrich and augment life, not deny it or denigrate it. If he believed in direct intervention, he would be a healer and not a writer. If he believed that he had the power to eliminate evil and sorrow, he would be a saint, not a spinner of words. Art is a healing process, as Nietzsche pointed out. But mainly for those who practice it. **A man writes in order to know himself, and thus get rid of self eventually. That is the divine purpose of art**. A true artist throws the reader back upon himself, aids him to discover in himself the inexhaustible resources which are his. No one is saved or healed except through his own efforts. The only genuine cure is the faith cure. Whoever uses the spirit that is in him creatively is an artist. To make living itself an art, that is the goal.
