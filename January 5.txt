I was sick over my New Year, with what I am not sure, but I am beginning to feel better. I am excited for 2022 as this will be the year I will improve a lot. I have a sense of who I am and what I want, and now it is time to pull the pieces together. My [New Year's Resolutions](https://chasedooley.blot.im/resolutions) include being healthier, doing better things, living the kind of life that I have in mind, etc. And, at twenty-five, this is when that is most important. 

> Make haste, then, dearest Lucilius, and think how much more speed you would put on if an enemy were pursuing you from behind -- if you saw mounted horsemen coming up from behind you, harrying your retreat. That is, in fact, what is happening; you are being pursued. Put on speed! Make your escape; get yourself to safety. Remind yourself often how fine a thing it is to reach the summit of life before you die, and then to be in peace as you wait out the remainder of your time, relying only on yourself. For once one possesses happiness, duration does not make it any happier. 

> (Seneca, "Letter 32: Steadiness of Aim", *Letters on Ethics to Lucilius*.)

Life is short, death is near. Seneca said we make life short with our inconsistency, with "one fresh start after another." Yes, I have made many fresh starts chasing answers to questions like who am I, what do I want, and what should I do with my life? I daydreamed of what I could become: writer, doctor, philosopher, scientist, professor. But when I woke up, I was still where I was. I was still who I was. I had many ambitions but no direction. The lesson was that sometimes we must choose to start before we are ready, or we risk wasting our time, our life. Instead of daydreaming about the options, live one.

What else? Things are well. I had a great holiday, and I will be back to work soon. I'm reading *Dreyer's English* by Benjamin Dreyer. I like it. Dreyer's wit makes what can be dry (the use of English) into something entertaining and valuable. Oh, I am playing games again. I finally got the chance to play through *Red Dead Redemption 2*, and what a game! I love its score, especially ["Unshaken" by D'Angelo](https://open.spotify.com/track/3okk47CKOqAm1TXmVPzNYf?si=f9aaa1b512074646) and ["American Venom" by Woody Jackson](https://open.spotify.com/track/3fJeJZlQVMCKZUw0BbPkSq?si=6d57ad653f164957). And I've played *Halo: Infinite*, which is a lot of fun with friends. I started *Stardew Valley*, and it is so soothing.
