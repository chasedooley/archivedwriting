# January 26

Late again. Yes, I know. I've been sick again. But I'm feeling better. And I'm feeling motivated to read, write, publish. And to ruthlessly destroy any distraction.

Last year, I spent 6% of my time watching YouTube videos. That's about 22 days worth of streaming. 32,014 minutes. 533.5 hours. I spent close to 81 hours watching YouTube in the last two weeks. It's astonishing and sad.

It's scary how addicting things can be. How easily we can waste our life without realizing it. As Seneca once wrote, "No loss is as shameful as the one that comes about through carelessness."

What else?
- I updated [my reading list to include works from *The Harvard Classics*](/reading-list-updated). 
- I have 30 old essays I want to revise and republish. I'll begin this today.
- I discovered ["Corcovado - Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars" by Stan Getz and Jo√£o Gilberto, et al](https://open.spotify.com/track/5nU7dvOfzYs9QVVL7YVNPE?si=12cc25e1815c4f2b). I love it.
