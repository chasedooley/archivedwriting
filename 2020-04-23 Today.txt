## thoughts or notes

Every project can be a 3x3 or 9 part structure, steming from the three-part structure in writing/storytelling. 

1. Three sections: beginning, middle, and end.
2. Each section has three parts: beginning, middle, and end.
3. Each part has three sub-parts: beginning, middle, and end.

That is structure upon which a story can be told. It doesn't make writing a good story any easier, but it does make it possible.

A beginning sets the story, the energy. There is the call to action. The balance is disturbed, good vs evil, light vs dark.
The middle increases the stakes. This is always the villain's section. It's the hero refusing the call in the perial of his friends. Darkness is winning here.
The end leads to the new beginning. It's the hero accepting the call. Light is prevailing but darkness is about to kick its ass (especially if the part leads into a middle section of a larger step, sub-part end to the next beginning).

Two modes of process motivation.

1. "Get there" mode. Get to the first completed essay. Get to the next day. Get to the pole. Just get to whatever is the next step in the process. When motivation is there, when certainty is there.

2. "Stay here" mode. Look at your progress, look how far you've come. Don't give that up; don't ever, ever break the streak. When motivation is waning, when uncertainty is present.
